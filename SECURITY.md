# Security Best Practices

This document outlines the security measures and best practices implemented in the TypeScript PulseQueue project.

## üîê Infrastructure Security

### IAM Policies (Principle of Least Privilege)

- **Lambda Execution Roles**: Each Lambda function has a dedicated IAM role with minimal required permissions
- **EventBridge Permissions**: Restricted to specific event buses with environment-based conditions
- **CloudWatch Logging**: Limited to function-specific log groups
- **DynamoDB Access**: Scoped to specific table ARNs with read/write permissions as needed
- **CloudWatch Metrics**: Restricted to specific namespaces with conditions

### Data Protection

- **Encryption at Rest**: DynamoDB tables use AWS managed KMS keys for encryption
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Enabled for DynamoDB tables to protect against data loss
- **TLS Encryption**: All API Gateway endpoints use HTTPS
- **VPC Security**: Resources deployed in private subnets where applicable

### Network Security

- **VPC Configuration**: Custom VPC with proper CIDR blocks
- **Security Groups**: Minimal required access rules
- **Private Subnets**: Monitoring resources deployed in private subnets
- **Internet Gateway**: Only where necessary for external access

## üõ°Ô∏è Application Security

### TypeScript Security

- **Strict Type Checking**: No `any` types allowed
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all event payloads
- **Error Handling**: Proper error boundaries and logging
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security audits via `npm audit`

### Secrets Management

- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data passed via environment variables
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Recommended for production secrets
- **Parameter Store**: Alternative for configuration management
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All secrets externalized

### Code Quality

- **ESLint**: Enforces code quality and security rules
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Prevents type-related vulnerabilities
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end validation

## üîç Monitoring & Observability

### Security Monitoring

- **CloudWatch Logs**: Centralized logging with retention policies
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Custom security metrics collection
- **Grafana Dashboards**: Real-time security monitoring
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error logging and alerting

### Audit Trail

- **AWS CloudTrail**: API call logging (recommended for production)
- **Lambda Execution Logs**: Detailed function execution logs
- **EventBridge Events**: Complete event flow tracking
- **DynamoDB Streams**: Data change tracking (if enabled)

## üöÄ CI/CD Security

### Pipeline Security

- **GitHub Actions**: Secure workflow execution
- **Secret Management**: GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
- **Security Scanning**: Trivy vulnerability scanning
- **Code Quality Gates**: Automated quality checks

### Deployment Security

- **Terraform State**: Encrypted S3 backend
- **State Locking**: Prevents concurrent modifications
- **Plan Review**: Manual review of infrastructure changes
- **Rollback Capability**: Quick rollback procedures

## üìã Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment

- [ ] All secrets externalized
- [ ] IAM policies follow least privilege
- [ ] Encryption enabled for all data stores
- [ ] Security groups properly configured
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested

### Runtime Security

- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Access logging enabled
- [ ] Error monitoring active
- [ ] Performance monitoring configured
- [ ] Incident response procedures documented

### Production Considerations

- [ ] AWS CloudTrail enabled
- [ ] VPC Flow Logs configured
- [ ] GuardDuty enabled (recommended)
- [ ] AWS Config rules configured
- [ ] Backup retention policies set
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan tested

## üö® Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedures

1. **Detection**: Monitor CloudWatch logs and metrics
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate impact and scope
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected resources
4. **Eradication**: Remove security threats
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Document and improve
