# TypeScript PulseQueue

A modern, type-safe, event-driven serverless e-commerce application built with TypeScript, AWS Lambda, EventBridge, DynamoDB, and comprehensive monitoring. This project demonstrates best practices for scalable, decoupled architectures, robust testing, infrastructure-as-code, and observability.

**⚠️ Disclaimer:** This is a lab project designed to demonstrate production-ready patterns and best practices. While every effort has been made to follow industry standards and ensure robustness, **no guarantees are given for actual production use**. Users should thoroughly review, test, and adapt the code and infrastructure to their own requirements before deploying in a real-world environment.

**🚀 Production-Ready (Aspirational):** The aim of this project is to be as close to production-ready as possible for educational and demonstration purposes.

## Bootstrap Infrastructure (S3 State Bucket + OIDC Provider)

Before deploying any application infrastructure, you must provision the foundational resources:

- **S3 bucket** for Terraform state storage
- **OIDC provider and IAM role** for secure GitHub Actions authentication (no AWS access keys required)

**Deploy with:**

- On Windows:
  ```powershell
  .\scripts\bootstrap-infra.ps1
  ```
  or
  ```powershell
  & .\scripts\bootstrap-infra.ps1
  ```
- On Linux/Mac:
  ```bash
  chmod +x scripts/bootstrap-infra.sh
  ./scripts/bootstrap-infra.sh
  ```

See [OIDC_SETUP.md](./OIDC_SETUP.md) for full details and migration steps.

## Environment-Agnostic Deployment

- **Strict Environment Variable Requirement:** All scripts and Lambda code require the `ENVIRONMENT` environment variable to be set. If not set, deployment and tests will fail fast.
- **No Fallbacks:** There is no default to `dev`—the environment must be explicitly specified for every deployment, test, or script run.
- **Terraform State Isolation:** Each environment (dev, staging, prod, etc.) has its own `backend.tf` file with a hardcoded S3 key for state isolation. Variables are not used in the backend block.
- **Lambda Environment Variables:** The `ENVIRONMENT` variable is injected into all Lambda functions via Terraform, ensuring dynamic resource naming and true environment agnosticism.
- **Deployment Script:** The `deploy.ts` script requires `--env` to be specified and propagates the environment variable to all build, test, and deployment steps.

## Overview

TypeScript PulseQueue is a concept/prototype app that demonstrates event-driven architecture using AWS services and TypeScript. It processes order events through a decoupled system with EventBridge routing and DynamoDB for inventory management. The goal is to showcase best practices for TypeScript, AWS Lambda, and infrastructure-as-code in a modern event-driven design.

### Key Features

- **EventBridge-Driven Lambda**: End-to-end event-driven flows
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation, no `any` types
- **Robust Testing**: Jest-based unit tests, automated post-deploy integration tests
- **Environment-Aware Infrastructure**: Modular, reusable, and isolated by environment
- **Code Quality**: ESLint integration and automated checks
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform-managed AWS resources
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, CloudWatch integration
- **Inventory Management**: DynamoDB-based stock reservation and tracking
- **Payment Processing**: Simulated payment flows with success/failure scenarios
- **Security First**: IAM least privilege, encryption at rest, comprehensive security practices
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing, security scanning, and deployment
- **OIDC Authentication**: GitHub Actions uses OIDC for AWS authentication (no long-lived access keys)

---

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Order Lambda**: Receives order events, reserves inventory, emits payment events
- **Payment Lambda**: Processes payment events, updates inventory based on payment outcome
- **Metrics Lambda**: Exposes Prometheus metrics for monitoring
- **EventBridge Buses**: Route events between services
- **DynamoDB Table**: Stores inventory state
- **API Gateway**: Exposes metrics endpoint for Prometheus scraping
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus and Grafana for observability

### Event Flow

```
OrderPlaced (EventBridge) → Order Lambda → PaymentRequested (EventBridge) → Payment Lambda → DynamoDB
                                                      ↓
                                              Metrics Collection
                                                      ↓
                                              Prometheus → Grafana
```

- **Order Lambda** increments `reserved` in DynamoDB and emits a payment event
- **Payment Lambda** decrements `reserved` and, on success, decrements `stock`
- **Metrics Collection** tracks performance, errors, and business metrics
- **Monitoring** provides real-time visibility into system health and performance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.x
- AWS CLI configured
- Terraform installed
- **Bootstrap infrastructure deployed** (see above)
- **No AWS access keys required in GitHub secrets** (uses OIDC)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd TypeScript-PulseQueue

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up AWS CLI (for local Terraform usage)
aws configure
```

---

## Development & Testing

### Unit Testing (Jest)

- All Lambda handlers have dedicated Jest test files (e.g., `scripts/order-service-handler.test.ts`)
- AWS SDK calls are mocked (no real AWS calls)
- Event payloads are provided as JSON files (see below)
- Run all unit tests:
  ```bash
  npm test
  # or for a specific handler
  npm run test:order-service
  ```
- **Unit test event file:** `scripts/order-service-event.local.json`
  ```json
  {
    "orderId": "test-order-123",
    "customerId": "test-customer-123",
    "items": [{ "sku": "prod-001", "quantity": 2 }]
  }
  ```

### Integration/Post-Deploy Testing

- Automated end-to-end test script: `scripts/post-deploy-test.ts`
- Uses `scripts/order-service-events.json` for test scenarios:
  ```json
  {
    "success": {
      "orderId": "test-success-123",
      "customerId": "customer-1",
      "items": [{ "sku": "prod-001", "quantity": 2 }]
    },
    "failure": {
      "orderId": "test-failure-456",
      "customerId": "customer-1",
      "items": [{ "sku": "prod-001", "quantity": 2 }]
    }
  }
  ```
- The script:
  - Resets inventory before each test
  - Sends both success and failure events
  - Waits for both Lambdas to process
  - Checks logs for expected outcomes
  - Asserts DynamoDB state is correct
- Run manually:
  ```bash
  npx ts-node scripts/post-deploy-test.ts
  ```
- Or as part of the deployment pipeline (see below)

## Deployment

### 🎯 **Deployment Strategy**

This project uses a **two-tier deployment approach**:

#### **1. Development Environment (Manual)**

- **Purpose**: Local development, testing, and experimentation
- **Method**: Direct deployment using `deploy.ts` script
- **Usage**: `npm run deploy -- --env=dev`

#### **2. Staging & Production (Automated CI/CD)**

- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing and live production
- **Method**: GitHub Actions with branch-based triggers
- **Intended Workflow**:
  - Push to `release*` branch → **Auto-deploy to staging**
  - Push to `main` branch → **Manual approval required for production**

### **Development Deployment**

For local development and testing:

```bash
# Deploy to development environment
npm run deploy -- --env=dev

# Or use the shortcut
npm run deploy:dev
```

This will:

1. Run ESLint code quality checks
2. Run all Jest unit tests
3. Build the Lambda package(s)
4. Run Terraform plan & apply
5. Run the post-deploy integration test
6. Set up monitoring infrastructure (Prometheus & Grafana)

### **Staging & Production Deployment**

**⚠️ Important**: The `deploy.ts` script supports staging and production environments for **completeness and testing purposes only**. The intended deployment method for staging and production is via **GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline**.

#### **Intended CI/CD Workflow**:

```bash
# For staging deployment
git checkout -b release/v1.2.3
git push origin release/v1.2.3
# → Automatically deploys to staging environment

# For production deployment
git checkout master
git merge release/v1.2.3
git push origin master
# → Requires manual approval for production deployment
```

#### **Branch Naming Convention**:

- `release*` branches → **Auto-deploy to staging**
- `master` branch → **Manual approval for production**

#### **Production Deployment Approval**:

Production deployments require manual approval for safety:

1. **Push to master** triggers the workflow
2. **Quality checks** run automatically (tests, linting, security scans)
3. **Manual approval** required before deployment
4. **Review changes** and approve/reject in GitHub Actions

**Setup**: See [GITHUB_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md](GITHUB_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md) for manual approval configuration.

#### **Manual Deployment (For Testing)**:

```bash
# Only use these for testing the deployment scripts
npm run deploy -- --env=staging  # Testing only
npm run deploy -- --env=prod     # Testing only
```

For detailed deployment instructions, see [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md).

## CI/CD Pipeline

### **Automated Pipeline Features**

- **Code Quality**: ESLint, TypeScript compilation, unit tests
- **Security Scanning**: Trivy vulnerability scanning, dependency audits
- **Infrastructure Validation**: Terraform format check, validation, plan review
- **Automated Deployment**: Build, test, and deploy on master branch
- **Post-Deployment Testing**: Integration tests after deployment
- **Security Notifications**: Alert on security issues

> **Note on Linting:**
> The Lambda build script (`scripts/build-lambda.ts`) automatically runs ESLint on each Lambda handler before building and packaging. However, for completeness and to ensure code quality across the entire repository—including shared libraries, utility scripts, and infrastructure code—the CI/CD pipeline also runs a dedicated linting step (`npm run lint:all`). This guarantees that all TypeScript code, not just Lambda handlers, is checked for style and correctness.

### **Pipeline Stages**

1. **Code Quality & Testing**
   - ESLint validation
   - TypeScript compilation
   - Unit tests
   - Security audit

2. **Infrastructure Validation**
   - Terraform format check
   - Terraform validation
   - Terraform plan (dry run)

3. **Security Scanning**
   - Trivy vulnerability scan
   - Dependency analysis
   - Code security review

4. **Deployment** (Master branch only)
   - Build Lambda packages
   - Terraform apply
   - Post-deployment tests
   - Monitoring setup

### **Branch-Based Deployment Strategy**

#### **Development Branch** (`development`, `feature/*`)

- ✅ **Code Quality Checks**: ESLint, TypeScript, unit tests
- ✅ **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability checks, dependency audits
- ✅ **Infrastructure Validation**: Terraform plan (dry run)
- ❌ **No Deployment**: Only validation and testing

#### **Release Branch** (`release*`)

- ✅ **All Development Checks**: Code quality, security, validation
- ✅ **Staging Deployment**: Automatic deployment to staging environment
- ✅ **Post-Deploy Tests**: Integration tests on staging
- ❌ **No Production Deployment**: Staging only

#### **Master Branch** (`master`)

- ✅ **All Previous Checks**: Code quality, security, validation
- ✅ **Production Deployment**: Manual approval required
- ✅ **Production Tests**: Post-deploy tests on production
- ✅ **Monitoring Setup**: Production monitoring configuration

## Monitoring

### Overview

The application includes comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus metrics collection and Grafana dashboards for real-time observability. The monitoring architecture is designed to handle the challenges of serverless environments where Lambda functions have no persistent state between invocations.

### Monitoring Architecture

#### Why CloudWatch + Prometheus?

**Problem**: Lambda functions lose in-memory metrics between invocations. Traditional Prometheus scraping from Lambda endpoints would only capture metrics from the current invocation, missing historical data.

**Solution**: Hybrid approach using both CloudWatch and Prometheus:

1. **CloudWatch Metrics**: Real-time Lambda metrics (invocations, errors, duration)
2. **Prometheus Metrics**: Custom business metrics (order processing, inventory levels)
3. **Grafana Dashboards**: Unified view combining both metric sources

### Monitoring Components

#### CloudWatch Dashboards

- **Lambda Performance**: Invocations, errors, duration, memory usage
- **EventBridge Metrics**: Event processing, failures, throughput
- **DynamoDB Metrics**: Read/write capacity, throttling, errors
- **API Gateway Metrics**: Request count, latency, error rates

#### Prometheus Metrics

- **Business Metrics**: Order processing rates, inventory levels
- **Custom Counters**: Stock reservations, payment success/failure
- **Performance Metrics**: Lambda execution times, error rates
- **Inventory Tracking**: Stock levels, reserved quantities

#### Grafana Dashboards

- **Application Overview**: End-to-end system health
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, throughput, error rates
- **Business Metrics**: Order processing, inventory management
- **Infrastructure Health**: AWS service status, resource utilization

### Alerting Configuration

```yaml
# Example CloudWatch Alarms
- High Error Rate: > 5% error rate
- High Latency: > 30 seconds response time
- Low Inventory: < 10 items in stock
- EventBridge Failures: > 0 failed events
```

### Accessing Monitoring

1. **Grafana Dashboard**: Access via the deployed Grafana instance
   - URL: `http://<ecs-public-ip>:3000`
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: Set via `TF_VAR_grafana_admin_password`

2. **CloudWatch Dashboards**: Access via AWS Console
   - Navigate to CloudWatch > Dashboards
   - Look for dashboards prefixed with `dev-pulsequeue-dashboard`

3. **Prometheus Metrics**: Access via API Gateway
   - URL: `https://<api-gateway-url>/metrics`
   - Returns Prometheus-formatted metrics

### Setting Up Monitoring

```bash
# Deploy monitoring infrastructure
npm run deploy:dev:ts

# Access Grafana dashboard
# Navigate to the ECS public IP on port 3000
# Login with admin / your-password

# View CloudWatch dashboards
# Navigate to AWS Console > CloudWatch > Dashboards
```

For detailed monitoring setup, see [MONITORING.md](./MONITORING.md).

## Event & Test File Reference

### Event Structure

All events follow a consistent structure:

```typescript
interface OrderEvent {
  orderId: string;
  customerId: string;
  items: Array<{
    sku: string;
    quantity: number;
  }>;
  timestamp?: string;
}
```

### Test Files

- **`scripts/order-service-event.local.json`**: Unit test events
- **`scripts/order-service-events.json`**: Integration test scenarios
- **`scripts/inventory-seed.json`**: Initial inventory data

### Event Flow Examples

#### Successful Order Processing

```json
{
  "orderId": "order-123",
  "customerId": "customer-456",
  "items": [{ "sku": "prod-001", "quantity": 2 }]
}
```

#### Failed Order Processing

```json
{
  "orderId": "order-456",
  "customerId": "customer-789",
  "items": [{ "sku": "prod-002", "quantity": 100 }]
}
```

---

## Best Practices

- **Type Safety**: All handlers and scripts are fully type-safe (no `any`)
- **Centralized Configuration**: All config in `services/shared/constants.ts`
- **Environment-Aware Resource Naming**: All AWS resources are named with environment prefixes (e.g., `dev-inventory-table`)
- **Infrastructure as Code**: All AWS resources managed via Terraform modules
- **Testing**: Robust unit and integration tests, with inventory reset and log assertions
- **Code Quality**: ESLint enforced, no explicit `any` allowed

---
