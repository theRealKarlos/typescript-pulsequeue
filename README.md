# TypeScript PulseQueue

A modern, type-safe, event-driven serverless e-commerce application built with TypeScript, AWS Lambda, EventBridge, DynamoDB, and comprehensive monitoring. This project demonstrates best practices for scalable, decoupled architectures, robust testing, infrastructure-as-code, and observability.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer:** This is a lab project designed to demonstrate production-ready patterns and best practices. While every effort has been made to follow industry standards and ensure robustness, **no guarantees are given for actual production use**. Users should thoroughly review, test, and adapt the code and infrastructure to their own requirements before deploying in a real-world environment.

**üöÄ Production-Ready (Aspirational):** The aim of this project is to be as close to production-ready as possible for educational and demonstration purposes.

## Overview

TypeScript PulseQueue is a concept/prototype app that demonstrates event-driven architecture using AWS services and TypeScript. It processes order events through a decoupled system with EventBridge routing and DynamoDB for inventory management. The goal is to showcase best practices for TypeScript, AWS Lambda, and infrastructure-as-code in a modern event-driven design.

### Key Features

- **EventBridge-Driven Lambda**: End-to-end event-driven flows
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation, no `any` types
- **Robust Testing**: Jest-based unit tests, automated post-deploy integration tests
- **Environment-Aware Infrastructure**: Modular, reusable, and isolated by environment
- **Code Quality**: ESLint integration and automated checks
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform-managed AWS resources
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, CloudWatch integration
- **Inventory Management**: DynamoDB-based stock reservation and tracking
- **Payment Processing**: Simulated payment flows with success/failure scenarios
- **Security First**: IAM least privilege, encryption at rest, comprehensive security practices
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing, security scanning, and deployment

---

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Order Lambda**: Receives order events, reserves inventory, emits payment events
- **Payment Lambda**: Processes payment events, updates inventory based on payment outcome
- **Metrics Lambda**: Exposes Prometheus metrics for monitoring
- **EventBridge Buses**: Route events between services
- **DynamoDB Table**: Stores inventory state
- **API Gateway**: Exposes metrics endpoint for Prometheus scraping
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus and Grafana for observability

### Event Flow

```
OrderPlaced (EventBridge) ‚Üí Order Lambda ‚Üí PaymentRequested (EventBridge) ‚Üí Payment Lambda ‚Üí DynamoDB
                                                      ‚Üì
                                              Metrics Collection
                                                      ‚Üì
                                              Prometheus ‚Üí Grafana
```

- **Order Lambda** increments `reserved` in DynamoDB and emits a payment event
- **Payment Lambda** decrements `reserved` and, on success, decrements `stock`
- **Metrics Collection** tracks performance, errors, and business metrics
- **Monitoring** provides real-time visibility into system health and performance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.x
- AWS CLI configured
- Terraform installed
- AWS credentials with appropriate permissions

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd TypeScript-PulseQueue

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up AWS credentials
aws configure
```

---

## Development & Testing

### Unit Testing (Jest)

- All Lambda handlers have dedicated Jest test files (e.g., `scripts/order-service-handler.test.ts`)
- AWS SDK calls are mocked (no real AWS calls)
- Event payloads are provided as JSON files (see below)
- Run all unit tests:
  ```bash
  npm test
  # or for a specific handler
  npm run test:order-service
  ```
- **Unit test event file:** `scripts/order-service-event.local.json`
  ```json
  {
    "orderId": "test-order-123",
    "customerId": "test-customer-123",
    "items": [{ "sku": "prod-001", "quantity": 2 }]
  }
  ```

### Integration/Post-Deploy Testing

- Automated end-to-end test script: `scripts/post-deploy-test.ts`
- Uses `scripts/order-service-events.json` for test scenarios:
  ```json
  {
    "success": {
      "orderId": "test-success-123",
      "customerId": "customer-1",
      "items": [{ "sku": "prod-001", "quantity": 2 }]
    },
    "failure": {
      "orderId": "test-failure-456",
      "customerId": "customer-1",
      "items": [{ "sku": "prod-001", "quantity": 2 }]
    }
  }
  ```
- The script:
  - Resets inventory before each test
  - Sends both success and failure events
  - Waits for both Lambdas to process
  - Checks logs for expected outcomes
  - Asserts DynamoDB state is correct
- Run manually:
  ```bash
  npx ts-node scripts/post-deploy-test.ts
  ```
- Or as part of the deployment pipeline (see below)

## Monitoring

### Overview

The application includes comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus metrics collection and Grafana dashboards for real-time observability. The monitoring architecture is designed to handle the challenges of serverless environments where Lambda functions have no persistent state between invocations.

### Monitoring Architecture

#### Why CloudWatch + Prometheus?

**Problem**: Lambda functions lose in-memory metrics between invocations. Traditional Prometheus scraping from Lambda endpoints would only capture metrics from the current invocation, missing historical data.

**Solution**: Hybrid approach using both CloudWatch and Prometheus:

1. **CloudWatch Metrics**: Real-time Lambda metrics (invocations, errors, duration)
2. **Prometheus Metrics**: Custom business metrics (order processing, inventory levels)
3. **Grafana Dashboards**: Unified view combining both metric sources

### Monitoring Components

#### CloudWatch Dashboards

- **Lambda Performance**: Invocations, errors, duration, memory usage
- **EventBridge Metrics**: Event processing, failures, throughput
- **DynamoDB Metrics**: Read/write capacity, throttling, errors
- **API Gateway Metrics**: Request count, latency, error rates

#### Prometheus Metrics

- **Business Metrics**: Order processing rates, inventory levels
- **Custom Counters**: Stock reservations, payment success/failure
- **Performance Metrics**: Lambda execution times, error rates
- **Inventory Tracking**: Stock levels, reserved quantities

#### Grafana Dashboards

- **Application Overview**: End-to-end system health
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, throughput, error rates
- **Business Metrics**: Order processing, inventory management
- **Infrastructure Health**: AWS service status, resource utilization

### Alerting Configuration

```yaml
# Example CloudWatch Alarms
- High Error Rate: > 5% error rate
- High Latency: > 30 seconds response time
- Low Inventory: < 10 items in stock
- EventBridge Failures: > 0 failed events
```

### Accessing Monitoring

1. **Grafana Dashboard**: Access via the deployed Grafana instance
   - URL: `http://<ecs-public-ip>:3000`
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: Set via `TF_VAR_grafana_admin_password`

2. **CloudWatch Dashboards**: Access via AWS Console
   - Navigate to CloudWatch > Dashboards
   - Look for dashboards prefixed with `dev-pulsequeue-dashboard`

3. **Prometheus Metrics**: Access via API Gateway
   - URL: `https://<api-gateway-url>/metrics`
   - Returns Prometheus-formatted metrics

### Setting Up Monitoring

```bash
# Deploy monitoring infrastructure
npm run deploy:dev:ts

# Access Grafana dashboard
# Navigate to the ECS public IP on port 3000
# Login with admin / your-password

# View CloudWatch dashboards
# Navigate to AWS Console > CloudWatch > Dashboards
```

For detailed monitoring setup, see [MONITORING.md](./MONITORING.md).

## Event & Test File Reference

### Event Structure

All events follow a consistent structure:

```typescript
interface OrderEvent {
  orderId: string;
  customerId: string;
  items: Array<{
    sku: string;
    quantity: number;
  }>;
  timestamp?: string;
}
```

### Test Files

- **`scripts/order-service-event.local.json`**: Unit test events
- **`scripts/order-service-events.json`**: Integration test scenarios
- **`scripts/inventory-seed.json`**: Initial inventory data

### Event Flow Examples

#### Successful Order Processing

```json
{
  "orderId": "order-123",
  "customerId": "customer-456",
  "items": [{ "sku": "prod-001", "quantity": 2 }]
}
```

#### Failed Order Processing

```json
{
  "orderId": "order-456",
  "customerId": "customer-789",
  "items": [{ "sku": "prod-002", "quantity": 100 }]
}
```
